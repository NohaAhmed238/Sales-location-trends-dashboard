This repository contains a Tableau dashboard analyzing sales trends across different locations. Data was cleaned and pre-processed using Python before visualization.

Created an interactive dashboard to analyze four years of US market product data using Tableau, 
comparing year-over-year revenue, sales, and quantities, and ranking products and subcategories by performance with color gradations showing revenue and sales. 
The dashboard supported data-driven decision making to improve performance.
